# 🧠 Financial Analysis Agent (MCP Multi-Agent System)

## 📘 Overview
**Financial Analysis Agent** is an intelligent multi-agent system designed to automate and streamline stock market analysis.  
Built using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, this project integrates multiple specialized AI agents to analyze financial data, technical indicators, valuation metrics, and news for **U.S. stocks**.

The system delivers a **comprehensive investment summary** by combining the reasoning of different analytical perspectives, enabling data-driven investment insights with minimal manual effort.

## 🧩 System Architecture

The system consists of **four key agents**, each responsible for a unique area of analysis:

| Agent | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| 🧮 **Technical Analysis Agent** | Examines stock price trends, momentum, and indicators such as RSI, MACD, and moving averages. |
| 💰 **Value Analysis Agent** | Evaluates financial ratios and valuation metrics (P/E, P/B, DCF) to estimate intrinsic value. |
| 🧾 **Fundamental Analysis Agent** | Reviews company financial statements, earnings reports, and key fundamentals. |
| 🧠 **Summary Agent** | Synthesizes results from all agents to produce a final investment recommendation and rationale. |

Agents communicate through the **MCP framework**, exchanging structured results and reasoning chains to produce cohesive analysis.
